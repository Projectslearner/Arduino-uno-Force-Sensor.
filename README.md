### Title: Force Sensor using Arduino UNO

### Description
This project demonstrates how to use a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) with an Arduino UNO to detect and categorize different levels of pressure. The FSR changes its resistance based on the applied force. The Arduino reads the sensor's analog value and outputs the corresponding pressure level to the Serial Monitor.

### Components Needed
1. **Arduino UNO**: The microcontroller board to run the program.
2. **Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)**: A sensor that changes resistance based on the applied force.
3. **10k ohm Resistor**: A pulldown resistor for the FSR.
4. **Breadboard**: A platform for prototyping the circuit.
5. **Jumper Wires**: Wires to make the necessary connections.

### Instructions
1. **Connect the FSR and Resistor**:
   - Insert the FSR into the breadboard.
   - Connect one leg of the FSR to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the other leg of the FSR to both the A0 analog input pin and one end of the 10k ohm resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the 10k ohm resistor to GND on the Arduino.

2. **Set Up the Arduino**:
   - Connect the Arduino UNO to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Write or paste the provided code into the IDE.

3. **Upload the Code and Test**:
   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE.
   - Click the upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.
   - Open the Serial Monitor from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE.
   - Apply different levels of pressure to the FSR and observe the analog readings and corresponding pressure level descriptions on the Serial Monitor.

### Summary
By following these steps, you will create a simple circuit that uses an FSR to measure and display different pressure levels on the Serial Monitor. This project is an excellent introduction to interfacing analog sensors with the Arduino and processing their readings for practical applications.
